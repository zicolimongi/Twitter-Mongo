[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

Mongoid::Errors::NoParent (
Problem:
  Cannot persist embedded document Tweet without a parent document.
Summary:
  If the document is embedded, in order to be persisted it must always have a reference to its parent document. This is most likely caused by either calling Tweet.create or Tweet.create! without setting the parent document as an attribute.
Resolution:
  Ensure that you've set the parent relation if instantiating the embedded document direcly, or always create new embedded documents via the parent relation.):
